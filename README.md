# playing-with-java

A repository of examples for learning concepts in Java. The examples alone will not be sufficient to learn Java but will be a good starting point to see how different things are done. 

All of the examples are separated with their own folders and will contain some READMEs on how to use the examples

Examples are currated from a Java Course In Udemy + I've extended some of them to be more easy to understand or to be more "real-world" like.
