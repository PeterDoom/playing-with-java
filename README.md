# playing-with-java

A repository of examples for learning concepts in Java. The examples alone will not be sufficient to learn Java but will be a good starting point to see how different things are done. 

All the examples are separated with their own folders and will contain some READMEs on how to use the examples

Examples are curated from a Java Course In Udemy + I've extended some of them to be more easy to understand or to be more "real-world" like.

## Order of folders: 
1. Prim
2. OOP Basics
3. Access Modifiers
4. Arrays and Lists
5. Interfaces
6. Generics
7. Abstract Classes
8. Java Colletions
9. Java Concurrency
10. Java IO
11. Lambdas (not yet finished, but should have a few examples)
